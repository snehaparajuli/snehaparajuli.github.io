###Lucy - A dog's diary!
<font face="verdana" color="white"
<p>Hello!	
I am Lucy and I am a dog!

Oh! It’s such a bright sunny morning. Thank god it is not raining right now. Actually, you know, it has been raining for many days. The weather has not so good lately. I don’t like rain, mainly because I have no boots to wear. I am a very “flu-tic” dog. I am sorry, I guess you didn’t understand what flu-tic is? It is obvious that you won’t understand it since it’s my language. It means that I am prone to cold. I easily get sick and suffer from cold frequently. 
But today I’m absolutely fine. I feel like jumping and playing with my butterfly friends. I should wake up now, shouldn’t I? Oh, wait. Am I locked inside my kennel? Obviously, I am. After doing such a great deed yesterday, Mom is certainly angry with me. I deserve this. Not only this, I deserve a harsher punishment. Do you want to know what I did?  Well then, wait for it.
First of all, I would like to start with my family members. Mom and Dad, who love me very much, play with me secretly but they don’t show it to others that they are fond of me. Shubha dada, Ashu didi and Sushin dada, they are the ones who buy me biscuits every day. And now the most important person to me, who loves me more than anyone, my Eshu didi. She takes care of me and gives me delicious food to eat. She even plays with me. She’s awesome!
Now, coming to the deed I committed… I ate mom’s phone. Oh Lord, how could I do that? I am such a fool. You know something, it might be awkward to say this, but it actually tasted very good. But somebody please tell mom that I didn’t do it intentionally. 
I think it is already 11 AM. Everyone must have left for the college and school. I woke up so late today. It may be because all my energy was wasted in chewing mom’s phone. Never mind, let’s see what’s going on around the neighbourhood. There are my butterfly friends playing in the garden without me. There is the neighbour’s dog Jackie looking at me from the roof of the house. I feel really sorry for him. How can he manage to stay in the terrace? Ugh! But I feel sorrier for myself. How can an energetic, playful and awesome dog like me be locked up in a kennel?
Wait, I have an emergency. I want to pee. But where’s mom? “Woof Woof…..Mom!! Where are you? You need to let me free. Otherwise, you’ll have to take care of my... pee :P haha!  I think someone’s coming here. Oh! It’s dad. Now he’s going to open the door. When he opens the door, I should be well mannered and go pee without jumping on his legs. He might be angry with me, right? Yay!! See, I told you he’ll let me free. I feel like a prisoner who has just been released from jail. I think even mom has forgiven me. From now on, I am not going to do anything that will make anyone upset. I just hope that I’ll be able to keep my words. Ok, I am going to play now, I’ll talk to you later. Byeee!

<p>I don’t enjoy solitude. I prefer people around me. I enjoy talking to people. I am more of an extrovert. There is this Japanese term called “kenzoku” which means “Family”. It’s a bond between people who share same destiny and have made a similar vow in their live. Many of us have people in our lives with whom we experience the bond described by the word kenzoku. They may be family members, a mother, a brother, a daughter, a cousin, a father, a sister or a friend. I always consider being with the people we love as happiness. We cherish the moments spent with our friends, family and loved ones. But the sad part is when we have to depart from each other without our willingness. I think that people come into your life for a reason and spend the time they’re meant to spend with. If someone is no longer in your life, it’s because they’re no longer supposed to be there. When we spend our life with the one person we cherish the most, we enjoy our life to the fullest. But the pain when that person leaves our life is way too much than those happy moments. 
To me, I never appreciate sudden departure. I don’t understand how people can feel the same without the person they’ve been for so long. How can people tolerate the feeling when important people of their life would just fade away? I know one day it is possible to get over with it but our life alters forever after we lose someone we cherish. No matter we get over with this kind of departure, but the clichés always remains there that causes trouble. We will always be able to stop the pain, we let new people to enter into our life and we start enjoying our life with them. But the sad part is the gap of our departure loved ones never fills. No one is able to replace their place. 
Taking our time and bidding a heartwarming goodbye can be a good way to decrease our grief. It avoids the regret of not being able to express a loving farewell with words of encouragement and thankfulness to them for being a part of our life and what they have meant to you. It is a blessing to have the time to say goodbye, rather than have someone taken all of a sudden. 
But to me I hate goodbyes. I have trouble giving up on people. I don’t like the feeling of losing someone whether we bid them farewell or not. I feel why can’t death dis

<p> My future husband,
I don’t know you and you don’t know me. I have no idea where will we meet or where you live. I also don’t know what will be the color of your skin, how is your family like? I don’t know if you know how to cook food because I am not so good at cooking. Perhaps we found each other gradually, as I have often fantasized of.
I want to know what are you fond of. I want to know will you give me that love which I have got from my parents till now. I want to know if we fight or if I get stubborn on something how will you react? I don’t yet know.
I promise to love you like the first day we met. I will never take you for granted but you will also have to do the same. I will always try to solve if there will arise any kind of misunderstanding. I will never stop myself from loving you because of some stupid fight. I will always remain by your side through the good days and bad.
I plan to make you happy in whatever conditions that may rise in our life. I will support you until you win in your each and every steps. In case you fail at something, I will always be there for you. I will never make you feel scarce. I will never let you down. I will always try to give you confidence. Be it small thing or big, I will always be proud of you and help you learn. 
I will always try to inspire you. I will try my fullest to make you a better person. I promise that my presence will always motivate you to become the best. 	I want to be the one who makes you realize how much proficient you are.
If any kind of obstacles arise in your path, I will always lend you my helping hand. I will walk with you in that path and I promise that we will overcome them together. We will win. I will be the medicine if we fight and get hurt.  I will be the reason to heal. We will never run away from the challenges, we will face them together and be stronger. We might not have a carefree relationship as we thought, but I will always be there for you and I will love you forever! 
											Your loving,
											Future wife
